# Text Classification and Sentence Generator 
## ValidatingÂ and Tweaking RNN
As our title, our project is divided into two parts.  The first part for our project is to compare recurrent neural network and other algorithms to classify the comments  whether it is a good comment or not to validate whether RNN is suitable for text area.  The second part is to use recurrent neural network make a sentence generator.  It will generate relevant comments based on the values entered.  This part is tweaking RNN and applying it in a novel way.

You can access and download the dataset we use in Amazon Fine Food Reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
Our dataset is in folder named amazon-fine-food-reviews. The csv file is about 286MB. 

Install Instruction:
Step 1: Install Anaconda, here is the link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/, download Python 3.7 version.</br>
Step 2: Open Anaconda Prompt, enter "pip install sklearn".</br>
Step 3: Enter "pip install scipy" in the Anaconda Prompt.</br>
Step 4: Enter "pip install tensorflow" in the Anaconda Prompt.</br>
Step 5: Enter "pip install keras" in the Anaconda Prompt.</br>
Step 6: Enter "pip install xboosting" in the Anaconda Prompt.</br>
Step 7: Open Anaconda Navigator and then Launch Jupyter Notebook.</br>
Step 8: Open the file Text Classification and Sentence Generator.ipynb where you put.</br>
Step 9: Use Enter + Shift at same time to run the project.

Because the dataset is large, I didn't upload it.
